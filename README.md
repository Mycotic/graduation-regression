## Introduction
We set out to use linear regression to solve a certain problem. Our approach was driven by our desire to work on an education sector related problem. Our search for suitable datasets was conducted keeping that goal in mind. We selected to work with data extracted from the website New York City Open Data. We setteld on predicting graduation rates based on the collected High School data.
## Data Exploration and Cleaning
We found two datasets fit for this project. One of them had graduation rate, class size and test results related to High School in New York City. However, we needed more appropriate features to work with. The second dataset provided us wuth demographic information about aforementioned schools. Therefore, the question arises, how does different demographics influence graduation rate of public schools in New York? We proceeded to clean these datasets in order to merge them and have our train and test sets ready.

### Queries:

```
1. How do different demographics effect graduation rates in NYC High School?
2. Do minority students graduate at a lesser rate than White students?
3.
